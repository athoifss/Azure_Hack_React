Frontend for a react application.
Concept - 
Patient opens a ticket for a medical consultation.
A HealthBot first makes a preliminary guess for the illness.
Depending on the reply by the bot , there are different scenarios.
 In case of medium risk for covid , user is consulted for a doctor appointment (offline) and doctor can then prescribe medicine. Then the ticket is sent into      monitoring stage.
 
 In case of high risk, location of nearest covid test center is shown to the user.
